<h2>Options</h2>
<p>Factorio has quite a few settings you can play around with to customize things how you want. Obviously there are multiple audio settings, and you can either play full screen or windowed, as well as multiple other graphical options. One of the main things you can customize though is the hotkeys, and there are a lot of them. The hotkey menu is a good thing to look at before you start playing so you know what certain buttons do and how to pull up certain windows, etc. However some of the key mappings aren't as apparent or can easily be over-looked in the hotkey menu and some of those are actually very important to enhance the game experience.</p>

<p>One last thing to note about the options menus is that you can enable experimental updates. This is actually recommended because the experimental builds are the latest ones and far more updated than the stable builds. The great thing about Factorio is even though the builds may be labeled as experimental, they rarely have any game breaking problems and are (at least in my experience) completely playable. Even if you enable this option, it will still give you the choice when a new update is out to download it or wait, so it doesn't just automatically install it without asking.</p>

<h2>Map Settings</h2>
<p>I just want to touch on a couple of things about the Map Settings. The first thing to go over is the option to turn on <strong>Peaceful Mode</strong>. When you go to start a new game, you will be brought to the Map Settings menu where you can customize some things about the map before it generates.</p>
<p>One of those settings is to turn on Peaceful Mode. It isn't really clear what that does initially, so I'll explain it here. Normally if you play with that setting turned off (it's off by default) then the enemies will attack you when you approach them or start firing on them, as well as send raiding parties to your base when your pollution hits their Spawners. However with Peaceful Mode on, they are entirely docile until you actually attack them. They will never attack your base without you going and attacking them first. Even if you run over and stand in a group of them, they won't attack you until you fire at them.</p>

<div class="cont-center"><img src="img/1.jpg" width="942" height="578" alt="map-generator GUI" longdesc="img/1.jpg" /></div>

<p>It can be good to turn this setting on if you are new and don't want to bother with the enemies, or if you just need some peace for doing a speed run or something.</p>
<p>The other two things to go over quickly are the Starting Area and the Map Exchange String. I just want to point out that the Starting Area defines the area in which it is guaranteed to be enemy free from the start. So in other words, the larger you set it the more space you will have between you and the enemies. If you set really small, the enemies will be almost right on top of you, literally. 
The next thing is the Map Exchange String. This is used to generate a copy of a map that already exists. So you can use it to have the same map as your friend if they give you the string for it, or you can use it to generate a duplicate map of one of your saves, etc. To be clear though, it is just the map itself, and doesn't include any structures or progress that may have been made. It is a fresh start from the beginning, but with the same map. It may not be exactly 100% the same though. Sometimes a few things change a bit, but for the most part it is the same. </p>
<p>Now in terms of the actual settings like Frequency, Size, and Richness, there is a link below to the wiki page that explains it in great detail. I am not going to go over it here because it would make this section far too long and complicated.</p>
<div class="xtrainfo">You can find all the info you need for how those settings work from <a href="http://www.factorioforums.com/wiki/index.php?title=World_generator">here</a></div>
