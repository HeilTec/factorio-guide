title: Initial observations
---

<p>After adjusting your map settings and hitting "generate" you will be spawned into the world, and greeted by a message with a short explanation of what happened, where you are, and your end objective. Once you have read it, just hit TAB to close it and you can start playing.</p>
<p>I find it is important to make some initial observations of the map and your surroundings. Since the map is randomly generated, it is entirely possible you have been given a spawn area with poor resource distribution. It is important to have access to all five resources in your starting area, or at least the basic four; <strong>Iron</strong>, <strong>Copper</strong>, <strong>Stone</strong>, and <strong>Coal</strong>. <strong>Oil</strong> will obviously become a much needed resource later on, but it isn't essential to have it right in the starting area as long as there is some nearby.</p>

<div class="cont-left"><img src="img/2.jpg" width="324" height="305" alt="map" longdesc="img/2.jpg" /></div>

<p>The first thing I would suggest is to open your map (M), and take a look around to see what resources you have been given in your starting area. <strong>Iron</strong> will be a light blueish/gray color, <strong>Copper</strong> is an orange color, <strong>Coal</strong> is black, <strong>Stone</strong> is a light brownish color, and <strong>Oil</strong> is the pink dots.</p>

<p>If you see that one or more of the resource types are not in your immediate vicinity, don't panic and restart yet! Even if you have the enemies turned on, there is still a good amount of room around the starting area to work with. So regardless of whether you have all the resources or not in the currently revealed area, you should take a walk around in all directions to see what else might be close by but was initially hidden by the Fog of War.</p>

<p>I also like to walk out far enough until I can see the first enemy base in each direction. The other thing to pay a little attention to is the landscape itself. While trees are nice visually and do slow down your pollution spread, they can be a huge pain to clear out. So having an area with some trees, but not being completely surrounded and blocked in by them is ideal.</p>


<p>After taking these initial observations, you should decide if you want to stick with the map you have been given or restart and give it another go. You will probably never find a perfect spawning area or entire map that meets all the ideal conditions.</p>

<p>Once you have found a suitable map, then it is time to plan out some building strategies and start collecting your first resources. This will be covered in the next section.</p>
