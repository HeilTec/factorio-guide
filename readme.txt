Hello,

This is the factorio guide readme, it is a very simple document with some information and terms about this repository.

The Guide is open to the public for viewing, forking and submitting pull requests.

We hope to have collaborators to help us make the guide as great as possible, but we want to remain in control of the content.
So if you would like to submit changes, it will be reviewed before either being merged or discarded.

Before you start we want to make some things clear,
We are still the owners of the guide and the contents of the repository,
Any changes or pull requests you submit will belong to us, and we may or may not include them in the guide,
And may or may not edit them in any way.

If you want to make sure you won't be wasting your time with work, email us at support[at]factorio.com before starting,
We can give advice, and make sure that we can work together to make the guide as great as possible.

I hope this is clear, if you have any questions feel free to email in.
