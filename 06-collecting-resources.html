title: Collecting resources

<p>Now it is time to start gathering resources and begin the early stages of building your factory! You will need Iron, Stone, Coal, and Copper. However, you will not need very much Copper for a little while. Iron is the main resource you will need right now, and for the near future. In fact you can never really have too much of it, especially in the early game when you need it for nearly everything you will have to make.</p>

<p>Alright, it is time to actually start mining those much needed resources! This early stage of the game commonly known as the Burner Stage is actually pretty simple and won't take too much explanation. You will use the Burner Miners to actually mine the resources, and then use Stone Furnaces to smelt the Iron and Copper into plates, and the Stone into bricks. The Burner Miners are pretty simple machines that just require fuel (coal or wood at this stage) to run. They don't mine the resources particularly fast, but they do it automatically without you having to do it yourself which is the important part!</p>

<p>The ore can be directly inserted into a furnace by just facing the miner towards it and butting them right up against each other. For the Iron and Copper just put some burner miners down on top of the ore patches, stick some fuel in them (either coal or wood) and then put a furnace in front of the miner and throw some fuel in it, and your off!</p>

<p>For the Stone, it is probably best to just have it dump directly into a chest since you won't need stone bricks right away. Oh, don't forget, you can tell which way a miner will output by having the advanced info turned on (ALT key). The little yellow arrow will show where it spits out the ore.</p>

<p>The coal is a little different. You obviously don't need to smelt it or refine it down any further than it already is, so you can just mine it and use the Coal Ore. There are two methods for mining and collecting it. Either do the same as you did with the stone and just have it inserted directly into a chest, or use this neat little trick illustrated in the picture below:</p>

<p>Notice how the miners are all facing each other in a sort of clockwise circle formation? Pretty much what this is doing is allowing the miners to spit their coal into the next one as if it had mined it itself. This works really well because it allows all the miners to constantly stay fueled and also collect coal until their fuel storage slot gets full. Then you can just walk by and grab from each one whenever you need coal. This can also be done with only two miners, just face them towards each other. 
That about covers everything for this very early stage of the game. You are really just trying to get enough resources to get some power up and running so you can really start automating everything. Establishing power will be covered shortly.</p>
