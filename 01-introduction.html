<p>Greetings, I'm Xterminator, a long time Factorio fan and player. I have played Factorio for almost 2 years, and have 400+ hours of gameplay so far.</p>

<p>I have written this guide with the hope it will help newer players (or even some more experienced players) learn some of the crucial concepts and ideas in Factorio. When I first started playing the game, I was quite frankly overwhelmed by it all, even after watching multiple YouTube videos about Factorio beforehand. I feel that a guide like this would have been extremely helpful when I got stuck at certain parts of the game or didn't know how something worked. So I am hoping that you can use this guide as a reference as you make your way through the game.</p>

<p>This is not one of those extremely in-depth, 200+ page strategy guides that walks you through every single item and step in the game. That would simply be too much work for one person to do, and I feel that it would spoil a lot of the great things about Factorio if you just had a guide to hold your hand every step of the way. So with that in mind, this guide covers the main concepts and stages of the game with some details on some of the smaller things but does not go over each individual little thing. Some of that is for you to figure out, which is, in my opinion, where a lot of the fun comes in. So without further ado, let's continueâ€¦
